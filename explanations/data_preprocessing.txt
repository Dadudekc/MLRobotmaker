data_preprocessing.py

Current State: Performs data preprocessing tasks including handling missing values, standardizing date columns, and renaming target columns.

To Check: Verify if data preprocessing is robust and flexible enough for various datasets. Ensure it handles missing values, date columns, and target column renaming correctly.

Missing Components: Additional functions like 'get_features_from_csv' and 'convert_and_sort_by_date' could be added for more comprehensive data preprocessing.

Current State Analysis

Preprocess Data Function (preprocess_data):

Performs preprocessing on the given dataset, including standardizing date columns, filling missing values, and standardizing target columns (if specified).
Standardize Date Column Function (standardize_date_column):

Standardizes the date column in the dataset by converting it to datetime format and sorting the dataset based on the date column.
Fill Missing Values Function (fill_missing_values):

Fills missing values in the dataset using methods like forward fill (ffill), backward fill (bfill), mean, or median, based on the specified fill_method.
Standardize Target Column Function (standardize_target_column):

Renames the target column in the dataset to a standard name, which is 'target' by default.
Improvements and Missing Components

Additional Functions:

Consider adding more preprocessing functions like 'get_features_from_csv' to load features from a CSV file or 'convert_and_sort_by_date' to sort data by date, which can enhance the flexibility of data preprocessing.
Suggested Timeline for Data Preprocessing Enhancements

Day 1-2:

Review and update existing preprocessing functions for better modularity and robustness.
Consider adding additional preprocessing functions if required.
Day 3:

Implement and test the newly added functions, ensuring they work seamlessly with existing code.
Day 4-5:

Conduct thorough testing of the entire data preprocessing module on various datasets to ensure it handles various scenarios correctly.
Day 6:

Gather user feedback and make adjustments based on testing results and user suggestions.
General Recommendations

Modularity: Ensure that the data preprocessing module is modular and easily extensible to accommodate new preprocessing requirements.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and logging to capture and report any issues during preprocessing.
Documentation: Provide clear documentation for each preprocessing function, specifying their inputs, outputs, and usage.
Testing: Rigorous testing on diverse datasets is essential to verify the correctness and robustness of the data preprocessing module.
By making these improvements, your data_preprocessing.py module can become a versatile and reliable tool for handling data preprocessing tasks in various scenarios.
