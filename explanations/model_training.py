`model_training.py` script is a comprehensive module for machine learning model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning, specifically tailored for various types of models. Here's an overview of its structure and functionality:

### Section 1: Imports and Setup
- Libraries: Includes essential libraries for data processing (numpy, pandas), machine learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost), and statistical modeling (statsmodels for ARIMA).
- Note: `tensorflow` and `joblib` are imported twice, which is redundant.

### Section 2: Model Training Functions - Part 1
- `train_model`: Trains a specified model type (linear regression, random forest, neural network, LSTM, ARIMA) with given training data.
- `create_neural_network`: Builds a customizable neural network.
- `create_lstm_model`: Constructs an LSTM model with adjustable layers and dropout rates.
- `train_arima_model`: Trains an ARIMA model with specified orders and trend.
- `create_ensemble_model`: Creates an ensemble model from a list of models, optionally using weights.

### Section 3: Model Evaluation
- `evaluate_model`: Evaluates a trained model on a test set using metrics like mean squared error and R² score.

### Section 4: Model Saving
- `save_model`: Saves models in appropriate formats based on their type (scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch).

### Section 5: Hyperparameter Tuning
- `CustomHyperModel`: A class for building neural network models with tunable hyperparameters for Keras Tuner.
- `perform_hyperparameter_tuning`: Function to conduct hyperparameter tuning for different types of models, including a neural network and random forest.

### Additional Functionality
- `load_model`: Loads a model from a specified file path, supporting various model types.
- `train_hist_gradient_boosting`: A specific function to train a Hist Gradient Boosting Regressor using data from a specified path. This function handles data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### Observations
- The script is versatile, covering a wide range of model types and functionalities.
- Redundant imports should be cleaned up.
- Some placeholder comments suggest parts of the code (like LSTM and ARIMA model training) might need further implementation.
- Exception handling is present in the `train_hist_gradient_boosting` function, indicating robustness in this part of the script.
