visualization.py

Current State: Handles chart creation using matplotlib and mplfinance.
To Check: Ensure all chart types needed for data visualization are implemented.
Missing Components: Integration tests for different data inputs.

----------------------------------------

Current State Analysis
create_candlestick_chart Function:

Utilizes mplfinance to create candlestick charts.
Requires DataFrame with OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data.
Adequate for displaying stock price movements over time.
create_line_chart Function:

Uses matplotlib to create line charts.
Displays 'close' price against 'date'.
Good for tracking single value trends over time.
Improvements and Missing Components
Data Validation:

Before plotting, validate that the DataFrame contains the required columns (e.g., 'date', 'close' for line charts, OHLCV for candlestick charts).
Implement error handling to provide user feedback if the data format is incorrect.
Expand Chart Types:

Depending on your application's needs, consider adding more chart types such as bar charts, area charts, or scatter plots for different data visualizations.
Histograms for distribution analysis or pie charts for market share visualizations could be beneficial.
Enhanced Customization:

Allow for more customization options in the chart functions, such as color schemes, axis labels, and font sizes, to improve readability and user experience.
Implement functionality to save charts as image files.
Integration Tests:

Implement integration tests for these functions with different types of data inputs to ensure they handle various scenarios (e.g., different date ranges, missing data).
Test with real and simulated datasets to ensure charts are plotted correctly and efficiently.
Performance Optimization:

Optimize chart rendering for large datasets. This can include data sampling or aggregation to improve performance and readability.
Evaluate the performance and memory usage, particularly for large or complex datasets.
Interactive Features:

Consider adding interactive elements to the charts if the GUI framework supports it. For instance, tooltips showing precise values on hover, zooming capabilities, or clickable elements.
This enhances the analytical capabilities of the charts.
Documentation and Examples:

Ensure that the functions are well-documented, including examples of usage.
Provide examples for different types of data inputs and chart customizations.
Suggested Timeline for Visualization Component
Day 1-2:
Implement data validation and error handling.
Start working on additional chart types.
Day 3:
Integrate enhanced customization options.
Begin developing interactive features.
Day 4-5:
Conduct performance optimization.
Write integration tests.
Day 6:
Finalize documentation and examples.
Review and refactor the code for clarity and efficiency.
General Recommendations
Modular Design: Ensure that the functions are modular and can be easily integrated with other parts of your application.
User Feedback: Consider how the charts will be used in the GUI and how users will interact with them.
Code Versioning: Regularly commit these changes to your version control system to track progress and facilitate collaboration.
By following these steps and timeline, you should be able to enhance the visualization capabilities of your application effectively.
